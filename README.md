Please ensure that you update your local branch before sending a PR, as conflicting PRs will not be attended to.

### Tips to stay updated

- `git remote add upstream <link/to/the/forked/repo`
- `git fetch upstream` gets the updated version of this repo
- `git merge upstream/master` this merges the fetched version with your local master
- `git checkout <your own branch>` takes you to your working branch
- `git merge master <working branch>` merge the local master with the branch you are working on.

Now you are set to push

- `git push origin <working branch` this will update your forked repo

At this point you can send your PR.

Thanks for contributing. You may add your name to the contributors file.
